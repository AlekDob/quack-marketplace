  "longDescription": "Meet Agent Swift, your dedicated iOS developer inside Quack.\n\nAgent Swift brings deep expertise in Apple's modern development stack, from SwiftUI's declarative views to Swift 6's strict concurrency model. Whether you're building a polished iOS app with fluid animations and platform-native feel, implementing structured concurrency with async/await and actors, or architecting a scalable codebase with MVVM and modern observation, Agent Swift follows Apple Human Interface Guidelines to deliver apps that feel right at home on every Apple device.\n\nEquipped with 3 specialized skills:\n- SwiftUI Best Practices: Build adaptive layouts with ViewBuilder, custom modifiers, @Observable state management, and animations that respect user accessibility settings\n- Swift Concurrency: Write data-race-free code using structured concurrency, actors, async sequences, and task groups -- modern patterns that replace GCD and completion handlers\n- iOS App Architecture: Design scalable apps with MVVM, dependency injection, navigation stacks, and proper separation between views, view models, and services\n\nAgent Swift writes clean Swift 6 code tested with both XCTest and Swift Testing, profiled with Instruments, and designed to pass App Store review. Every view is accessible, every animation is interruptible, every state transition is predictable.",
