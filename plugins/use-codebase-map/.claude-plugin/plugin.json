  "description": "Rule that instructs AI agents to read the auto-generated codebase map before exploratory code searches. Reduces tool calls by 60-80%.",
  "longDescription": "A simple rule that dramatically reduces how many tool calls your agents need to navigate your codebase.\n\nWithout this rule, agents typically run a chain of Glob, Grep, and Read calls to find the right file -- often 5 to 10 exploratory operations before locating a single export. With this rule installed, agents first read the auto-generated codebase map at .quack/codebase-map.md, find the exact file and export they need, and go directly there in a single Read call.\n\nThe result is 60-80% fewer tool calls for code exploration tasks, which means faster responses, lower token usage, and agents that spend more time writing code instead of searching for it. The codebase map is auto-updated by a PostToolUse hook whenever files change, so agents always have current information. Essential for any project with more than a handful of source files.",
