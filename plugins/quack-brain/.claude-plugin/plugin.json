  "longDescription": "The most comprehensive knowledge management plugin for Quack. Quack Brain transforms your agents into knowledge workers that learn, remember, and recall.\n\nAt its core, Quack Brain is a file-based Second Brain system that stores patterns, bug fixes, architectural decisions, and project gotchas as structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Your agents automatically evaluate whether new discoveries are worth saving and file them in the right category. No database, no external service, no corruption risk -- just markdown files organized by project and topic.\n\nThis plugin bundles 6 specialized skills:\n- Quack Brain: The core knowledge store with two-level architecture (project-specific and global cross-project knowledge)\n- Codebase Map: Auto-generated index of all exports in your codebase, reducing exploratory tool calls by 60-80%\n- Obsidian Markdown: Create and edit notes in your Obsidian vault with proper frontmatter, tags, and linking\n- Obsidian Canvas Creator: Generate visual canvas files that map relationships between concepts\n- Obsidian Bases: Work with Obsidian's structured data and database-like views\n- Human Test Plan: Generate structured test plans for manual QA when automated testing is not enough\n\nIncludes a dedicated Brain Manager agent for organizing and maintaining your knowledge base over time.",
