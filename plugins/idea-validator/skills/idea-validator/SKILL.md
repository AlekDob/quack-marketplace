# Idea Validator

This skill provides brutally honest, data-driven validation of app ideas before investing time in development.

## Purpose

Save builders from wasting weeks or months on ideas that have no market, are too crowded, can't be monetized, or are simply uninteresting. The validator provides quick, actionable feedback based on real market research, competitor analysis, and feasibility assessment.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill **before starting any new project or significant feature**. Ideal scenarios:

- Evaluating a new app or SaaS idea
- Considering a side project or indie hacker venture
- Deciding between multiple ideas
- Validating feature additions to existing products
- Getting a reality check before committing time

## Validation Process

The skill performs comprehensive analysis across five key criteria:

### 1. Market Analysis
- Competitor research with real products and URLs
- Market saturation assessment
- Differentiation opportunities

### 2. Demand Validation
- Real user signals from Product Hunt, Reddit, HackerNews
- Pain point verification
- "Nice to have" vs "must have" assessment

### 3. Feasibility Check
- Solo builder time estimate (1-2 weeks to 8+ weeks)
- Technical complexity rating
- MVP scope definition

### 4. Monetization Reality Check
- Competitor pricing benchmarks
- Revenue model recommendations
- Willingness to pay assessment

### 5. Interest Factor Gut Check
- Honest appeal assessment
- Founder-market fit
- Timing analysis

## Output

Generates a comprehensive validation report with:
- Quick Verdict: Build it / Maybe / Skip it
