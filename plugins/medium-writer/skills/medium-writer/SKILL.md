# Medium Writer

Write and publish high-performing Medium articles for tech and developer audiences. Optimized for engagement, SEO, and authentic indie developer voice. Includes automated draft publishing to Medium via agent-browser.

## When to Use

- Drafting a new Medium article from scratch
- Optimizing an existing article's title, structure, or tone
- Planning article strategy (topic selection, angle, target publication)
- Writing promotional/launch content for developer tools
- Adapting content for international English audiences
- **Publishing a draft directly to Medium** (via agent-browser)

## Author Context

Customize this section with your own details:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Author** | Your Name |
| **Voice** | Indie developer, builder |
| **Location** | Your Location |
| **Audience** | Global developers, indie makers |
| **Language** | English (simple, international) |
| **Primary topics** | Your main topics (e.g., AI coding, developer tools, productivity) |
| **Publications** | Your target publications |

## Title Formulas (Data-Driven)

Based on real performance analysis of published articles, these patterns consistently drive higher engagement:

### Winning Patterns

1. **"I + Past Verb + Tool/Result"** — Personal narrative with specific outcome
   - "I Stopped Using One Claude Code Session. I Now Ship 3x Faster."
   - "I Built an Entire App With Claude Code in 45 Minutes"
   - "I Replaced My IDE With an AI Terminal"

2. **Numbers + Metric** — Concrete, measurable claims
   - "3x Faster", "10+ Sessions", "45 Minutes", "12 Hours/Month"
   - Odd numbers and specific metrics outperform round numbers

3. **Tool Name in Title** — SEO anchor for discoverability
   - Always include the primary tool/technology name
   - "Claude Code", "Cursor", "GPT-4" — tool names drive search traffic

4. **Tension/Contrast** — Before/after or unexpected twist
   - "I Stopped X. Now I Y."
   - "Everyone Does X. Here's Why I Do Y."
   - "The X Nobody Talks About"

### Title Rules

- Keep under 70 characters for full display on Medium cards
- Use sentence case (capitalize first word and proper nouns only)
- No clickbait — every claim must be backed in the article
- Test with the "Would I click this on my feed?" filter
- Avoid colons in titles — use periods or em dashes instead
- Two short sentences often outperform one long title

### Patterns to Avoid

- Generic how-to titles without personal angle ("How to Use Claude Code")
- Question titles that feel like SEO spam ("Is Claude Code Worth It?")
- Titles with no specificity ("My Experience with AI Coding")
- All-caps words or excessive punctuation

## Article Structure

### Optimal Length

| Type | Words | Reading Time | Use Case |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Short** | 800-1200 | 4-5 min | Hot take, single insight, opinion piece |
| **Standard** | 1500-2000 | 7-8 min | Feature article, tutorial, case study |
| **Deep dive** | 2500-3500 | 12-15 min | Comprehensive guide, research piece |

Standard (7-8 min) is the sweet spot for developer audiences. Long enough for substance, short enough to finish.

### Structure Template

Every article should follow this skeleton, adapted to the specific angle:

```
1. HOOK (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Open with a specific, relatable moment
   - Create immediate identification ("Every X user knows this feeling")
   - No generic intros — start in the middle of the action

2. THE PROBLEM (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Name the pain point clearly
   - Quantify it with numbers if possible (time wasted, money lost, effort spent)
   - Make the reader feel the pain they've been ignoring

3. THE DATA / EVIDENCE (1-2 paragraphs + table/list)
   - Share real numbers, metrics, or observations
   - Use tables for before/after comparisons
   - "I tracked X for Y days. Here's what I found:"

4. THE SOLUTION (3-4 paragraphs)
   - How the problem was solved
   - Concrete workflow, not abstract advice
   - Show the actual process (code blocks, timelines, screenshots)

5. THE RESULTS (2-3 paragraphs + metrics)
   - Before/after comparison with specific numbers
   - Honest about trade-offs and downsides
   - "What I Got Wrong" section builds credibility

6. THE TAKEAWAY (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Actionable next step the reader can do today
   - Start small — give them a 5-minute version
   - Tool-agnostic principle (not just a product pitch)

7. AUTHOR BIO (see "Author Bio & Footer" section below)
   - Always included, always italic
   - Mentions your projects naturally
   - Never the main focus — just "here's who I am"
```

### Hook Patterns That Work

- **The Moment**: "Every Claude Code user knows this feeling. You type a request. Claude starts working. And then you wait."
- **The Counter-Intuitive**: "The most productive thing I did this year was stop coding."
- **The Number**: "36 minutes. That's how much time I wasted every day watching a spinner."
- **The Contrast**: "Everyone's talking about AI replacing developers. Nobody's talking about the 40% of time developers waste waiting for AI."

## Tone & Voice

### Core Principles

1. **Simple English** — Write for a global audience (ESL-friendly)
   - Short sentences. Active voice. Common words.
   - Avoid idioms, slang, and culturally-specific references
   - If a word has a simpler synonym, use the simpler one

2. **Show, Don't Sell** — The article teaches; the product is mentioned naturally
   - Never lead with the product pitch
   - Spend 80% on the problem/insight, 20% on the solution/tool
   - The reader should learn something even if they never use your product
   - Mention your tool in "The Setup" section, not the introduction

3. **Honest About Trade-offs** — Always include a "What I Got Wrong" section
   - Admit costs, limitations, and downsides
   - This builds massive credibility
   - "Not everything improved" is more persuasive than a victory lap

4. **Conversational but Not Casual** — Write like you're explaining to a senior dev at a coffee shop
   - No "bro" language, no memes, no forced humor
   - Technical when needed, plain when possible
   - Code blocks and tables break up wall of text

5. **Indie Developer Voice** — You're a maker sharing real experience
   - "I built", "I tracked", "I found" — first person, real experience
   - Reference specific dates, metrics, situations
   - "Six months later, that idea became a desktop app" — tell the story

### Formatting Rules

- Paragraphs: max 3-4 sentences
- Use section separators (`...`) between major sections — adds visual breathing room
- Code blocks for technical examples, timelines, and workflows
- Tables for comparisons and metrics
- Bold for key phrases (sparingly — max 2-3 per section)
- Italic for internal thoughts and emphasis
- Bullet lists for actionable steps (numbered for sequential, bulleted for unordered)
- Subheadings every 200-300 words

## SEO Optimization

### Meta Fields

For every article, define these:

| Field | Guidelines |
|-------|-----------|
| **Title** | Under 70 chars, follows winning patterns above |
| **Subtitle** | 1 sentence expanding the title, under 140 chars |
| **Tags** | Exactly 5 tags, mix of broad + specific |
| **SEO title** | Under 60 chars for Google snippet display |
| **SEO description** | Under 155 chars, includes primary keyword |

### Tag Strategy

Use exactly 5 tags per article:

1. **Primary topic** — The main technology (e.g., "Claude Code", "AI")
2. **Category** — The broad area (e.g., "Programming", "Software Development")
3. **Specific niche** — The sub-topic (e.g., "Developer Tools", "Productivity")
4. **Trending** — A currently popular tag (e.g., "Artificial Intelligence", "ChatGPT")
5. **Audience** — Who reads this (e.g., "Software Engineering", "Startup")

### Internal Linking

- Link to 1-2 of your own previous articles when relevant
- Use anchor text that matches the linked article's topic
- Place internal links naturally in the "Related" context, not forced

## Publication Targeting

### Recommended Publications

| Publication | Best For | Audience Size |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Better Programming** | Tutorials, tools, workflows | 700K+ followers |
| **Towards AI** | AI tools, ML workflows | 500K+ followers |
| **The Startup** | Founder stories, product launches | 800K+ followers |
| **Level Up Coding** | Practical dev content | 600K+ followers |
| **JavaScript in Plain English** | JS/React/Node specific | 400K+ followers |

### Submission Tips

- Follow publication guidelines exactly (each has specific rules)
- Self-published articles can be added to publications later
- Publications boost distribution significantly (2-5x views)
- First 30 minutes of engagement determine algorithmic boost

## Content Calendar Patterns

### High-Engagement Timing

- **Best days**: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday (highest engagement)
- **Good**: Monday (strong for tech — devs start the week reading)
- **Avoid**: Weekends (especially Sunday afternoon), Friday afternoon
- **Best time**: 6-8 AM EST = 12-14 CET = catches US morning coffee + EU lunch break
- **Why this matters**: Medium's algorithm weighs the first 4-6 hours of engagement heavily. Publishing when both US East Coast and Europe are active maximizes the initial boost window.
- **Rule of thumb**: If your audience is global tech/dev, publish between 12:00-14:00 CET on a weekday. This hits US morning, EU afternoon, and UK lunchtime simultaneously.

### Article Types to Rotate

1. **Launch Article** — "I Built X and Here's What Happened"
2. **Pain Point Article** — "The Hidden Cost of Y That Nobody Talks About"
3. **Workflow Article** — "How I Do X (Step by Step)"
4. **Comparison Article** — "X vs Y: I Tried Both for 30 Days"
5. **Lessons Learned** — "What I Got Wrong About X"

## Promotional Cross-Posting

After publishing on Medium:

1. **X/Twitter thread** — 5-7 tweet thread summarizing key points, link in last tweet
2. **Reddit** — Share in relevant subreddit with value-first comment
3. **Discord** — Post in community channels with personal note
4. **LinkedIn** — Shorter version (3-4 paragraphs) with link to full article

## Author Bio & Footer

Every article ends with an italic bio block. The bio serves two purposes: establish credibility and give readers a way to connect.

### Bio Structure

The bio has 3 parts:

1. **Who I am** — One sentence. Name, role, location.
2. **What I do** — One sentence. Mix of projects/interests.
3. **Where to find me** — Links. Casual tone.

### Anti-Spam Rules

- Never end an article with a hard product pitch. The article's value stands alone.
- Your product is mentioned as context ("I'm building X"), not as a CTA ("Go download X").
- Always include at least one non-product interest or project to diversify the bio.
- The bio should feel like a Twitter profile, not an ad.
- Rotate the bio slightly between articles to avoid copy-paste fatigue.

### Bio Template

```
*I'm [Your Name], a [role] building things from [Location]. Currently working on [Your Project](https://your-project.com) and writing about [your topics]. Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yourhandle) or at [your-site.com](https://your-site.com).*
```

### Key Principle

The reader should think: "This person is interesting and builds cool stuff" — not "This person is trying to sell me something."

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing, verify:

- [ ] Title follows winning patterns (I + verb, numbers, tool name)
- [ ] Title under 70 characters
- [ ] Subtitle under 140 characters, expands the title
- [ ] Hook grabs attention in first 2 sentences

## Local Draft Storage

Save all article drafts locally before publishing:

- **Filename**: Kebab-case from title (e.g., `I-Stopped-Waiting-For-Claude-Code.md`)
- **Frontmatter**: Include title, subtitle, date, status (draft/published), tags, target publication, reading_time, pattern used, seo_title, seo_description

If using Obsidian, save to your articles folder (e.g., `6 - Projects/Medium Articles/`).

## Publishing to Medium (agent-browser)

After writing the article locally, publish it as a draft directly on Medium using agent-browser with CDP connection to the user's real Chrome browser.

### Prerequisites

- `agent-browser` installed globally: `npm install -g agent-browser`
- Chrome running with remote debugging: user must launch Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-debug`
- User must be logged into Medium in that Chrome instance

### Pre-Flight Check

Before any publishing operation, always verify the CDP connection:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9222/json/version
```

If this fails, ask the user to:
1. Close Chrome completely (Cmd+Q)
2. Reopen with: `/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-debug`
3. Log into Medium manually (Google or Facebook)

### agent-browser Binary

The binary location depends on your installation. Common paths:
- macOS (Homebrew): `/opt/homebrew/bin/agent-browser`
- npm global: `npx agent-browser`

All commands use `--cdp 9222` flag **before** the command:

```bash
agent-browser --cdp 9222 <command> [args]
```

### Publishing Workflow

#### Step 1: Open New Story

```bash
agent-browser --cdp 9222 open https://medium.com/new-story
```

Wait for confirmation: should show "New story - Medium".

#### Step 2: Insert Title

Medium's title is an `<h3>` with `data-testid="editorTitleParagraph"`. Use `selectNodeContents` + `insertText` to replace the placeholder:

```bash
agent-browser --cdp 9222 eval "
const h3 = document.querySelector('h3[data-testid=\"editorTitleParagraph\"]');
h3.click();
h3.focus();
const range = document.createRange();
range.selectNodeContents(h3);
const sel = window.getSelection();
sel.removeAllRanges();
sel.addRange(range);
document.execCommand('insertText', false, 'YOUR TITLE HERE');
"
```

#### Step 3: Insert Body Paragraphs

After inserting the title, press Enter to move to the body, then use `insertText` for each paragraph:

```bash
agent-browser --cdp 9222 press Enter
agent-browser --cdp 9222 eval "document.execCommand('insertText', false, 'First paragraph text here.')"
```

For multiple paragraphs, press Enter between each:

```bash
agent-browser --cdp 9222 press Enter
agent-browser --cdp 9222 eval "document.execCommand('insertText', false, 'Next paragraph text.')"
```

For empty line spacing between paragraphs, use two Enter presses:

```bash
agent-browser --cdp 9222 press Enter
agent-browser --cdp 9222 press Enter
```

#### Step 4: Insert Headings (CRITICAL — Do NOT Use Markdown Syntax)

**IMPORTANT**: Medium does NOT auto-convert `## ` or `### ` to headings. Typing `## My Heading` will render as literal text `## My Heading`. You MUST use keyboard shortcuts instead.

**Section heading (h3)** — equivalent to `##` in markdown:
```bash
# First insert the heading text as plain text
agent-browser --cdp 9222 eval "document.execCommand('insertText', false, 'My Section Heading')"
# Then convert the current paragraph to h3 with the keyboard shortcut
agent-browser --cdp 9222 press "Alt+Meta+1"
# Then press Enter to move to the next line
agent-browser --cdp 9222 press Enter
```

**Subheading (h4)** — equivalent to `###` in markdown:
```bash
agent-browser --cdp 9222 eval "document.execCommand('insertText', false, 'My Subheading')"
agent-browser --cdp 9222 press "Alt+Meta+2"
agent-browser --cdp 9222 press Enter
```

**Verify headings** in snapshot output — they should appear as:
- `heading "My Section Heading" [level=3]` (correct)
- NOT `paragraph: "## My Section Heading"` (wrong — literal text)

#### Step 5: Insert Separators (Section Dividers)

Use `...` (three dots) to insert Medium's section divider. Medium renders these as the familiar centered three-dot separator between major sections:

```bash
agent-browser --cdp 9222 eval "document.execCommand('insertText', false, '...')"
agent-browser --cdp 9222 press Enter
```

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT use `---` (three dashes) — Medium converts them to a bulleted list, not a separator. Only `...` works.

Add a separator before each major `h3` section heading. Do NOT add separators before `h4` subheadings within a section.

#### Step 6: Insert Bold/Italic

For inline formatting, use keyboard shortcuts:
- **Bold**: Select text, then `Meta+b`
- **Italic**: Select text, then `Meta+i`

Or insert formatted text line by line, letting the user add formatting in the review step.

#### Step 7: Verify and Save

Medium auto-saves. Verify the draft was saved:

```bash
agent-browser --cdp 9222 snapshot | head -20
```

Look for `text: DraftSaved` in the output. If you see "Something is wrong and we cannot save your story", the text insertion method may have caused issues — try with a fresh `new-story` page.

### Important Technical Notes

- **NEVER use `fill` command** for Medium's editor — it causes "Something is wrong" errors. Always use `eval` with `document.execCommand('insertText', ...)`.
- **NEVER use `type` command** — it doesn't work with Medium's contenteditable editor.
- **NEVER use markdown heading syntax** (`## `, `### `) — Medium renders them as plain text. Use `Alt+Meta+1` (h3) and `Alt+Meta+2` (h4) keyboard shortcuts instead.
- **NEVER use `---` for separators** — Medium converts dashes to bulleted lists. Use `...` (three dots) instead.
- **Always use `--cdp 9222`** before the command, not `--cdp-endpoint http://localhost:9222`.
- **Cloudflare blocks Playwright's Chromium** — session-only mode (without CDP to real Chrome) will be blocked. CDP to the user's real Chrome is required.
- **Press Enter** creates a new paragraph in Medium. Two Enter presses create an empty line between paragraphs.
- The placeholder text "Tell your story..." is a ghost element — it disappears once real content is typed.

### Recommended Insertion Pattern (Shell Script)

For long articles, write a shell script with helper functions. This ensures consistent formatting:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
AB="agent-browser --cdp 9222"

p() {
  $AB eval "document.execCommand('insertText', false, $(printf '%s' "$1" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.dumps(sys.stdin.read()))"))"
  $AB press Enter
}

h2() {
  $AB eval "document.execCommand('insertText', false, $(printf '%s' "$1" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.dumps(sys.stdin.read()))"))"
  $AB press "Alt+Meta+1"
  $AB press Enter
}

h3() {
  $AB eval "document.execCommand('insertText', false, $(printf '%s' "$1" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.dumps(sys.stdin.read()))"))"
  $AB press "Alt+Meta+2"
  $AB press Enter
}

sep() {
  $AB eval "document.execCommand('insertText', false, '...')"
  $AB press Enter
}

nl() { $AB press Enter; }

# Usage:
p "Normal paragraph text."
nl                          # empty line spacing
sep                         # section divider (...)
h2 "Section Heading"        # h3 in Medium
p "First paragraph of section."
h3 "Subheading"             # h4 in Medium
p "Content under subheading."
```

### Limitations

- **Images**: Cannot be uploaded programmatically yet. The article is published as text-only draft. User adds images during review.
- **Code blocks**: Use the "Add a new code block" button (visible in snapshot) or type triple backticks. This may require additional testing.
- **Embeds/Links**: Medium auto-detects URLs. Just paste the URL as text and Medium will offer to embed it.
- **No publish/schedule**: The skill only creates drafts. User reviews and publishes manually.

### Full Example: Publish an Article

```bash
#!/bin/bash
AB="agent-browser --cdp 9222"

p() {
  $AB eval "document.execCommand('insertText', false, $(printf '%s' "$1" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.dumps(sys.stdin.read()))"))"
  $AB press Enter
}
h2() {
  $AB eval "document.execCommand('insertText', false, $(printf '%s' "$1" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.dumps(sys.stdin.read()))"))"
  $AB press "Alt+Meta+1"
  $AB press Enter
}
sep() {
  $AB eval "document.execCommand('insertText', false, '...')"
  $AB press Enter
}
nl() { $AB press Enter; }

# 1. Pre-flight
curl -s http://localhost:9222/json/version

# 2. Open new story
$AB open https://medium.com/new-story

# 3. Insert title
$AB eval "
const h3 = document.querySelector('h3[data-testid=\"editorTitleParagraph\"]');
h3.click(); h3.focus();
const range = document.createRange();
range.selectNodeContents(h3);
const sel = window.getSelection();
sel.removeAllRanges(); sel.addRange(range);
document.execCommand('insertText', false, 'My Article Title Here');
"
$AB press Enter

# 4. Subtitle
p "Subtitle text explaining the article angle."
nl

# 5. Hook paragraphs
p "Opening hook paragraph."
nl
p "Second paragraph expanding the hook."

# 6. First section with separator + heading
sep
h2 "Section Heading"
p "First paragraph of section."

# 7. Verify
$AB snapshot | head -25
# Look for: heading [level=3], separator: ..., DraftSaved
```

### Post-Publish Workflow

After the draft is created on Medium:
1. **Notify the user** with the draft URL (get it from snapshot or `get url`)
2. **User reviews**: formatting, adds images, adjusts layout
3. **User publishes**: manually via Medium's Publish button
4. **Update local draft**: change frontmatter status from `draft` to `published`, add Medium URL
