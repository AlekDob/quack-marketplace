  "longDescription": "**Code Graph MCP** replaces flat codebase maps with real code intelligence via an MCP server.\n\n### What it does\n- **AST-based parsing** using ast-grep for accurate code understanding\n- **Find definitions** and **references** across your entire codebase\n- **Caller/callee analysis** to understand function relationships\n- **Cyclomatic complexity** analysis with actionable recommendations\n- **Dependency mapping** with circular dependency detection\n- **25+ languages** including TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, Python, Go, Swift, and more\n\n### Why use it\n- Reduces Claude's exploratory tool calls by 40%+ (fewer Glob/Grep round-trips)\n- Sub-microsecond response times on cached queries\n- Real-time graph updates via file watcher\n- Works across mixed-language codebases (e.g., Tauri: Rust + TypeScript)\n\n### Setup\n```bash\npip install code-graph-mcp ast-grep-py rustworkx\nclaude mcp add code-graph-mcp code-graph-mcp\n```\n\n### Requirements\n- Python 3.10+\n- pip (Python package manager)",
