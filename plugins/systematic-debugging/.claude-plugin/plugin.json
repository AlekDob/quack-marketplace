  "longDescription": "Stop guessing. Start debugging systematically.\n\nThis skill enforces a rigorous four-phase methodology that eliminates the habit of random fixes and symptom patching. Phase 1 (Root Cause Investigation) requires reading error messages carefully, reproducing consistently, checking recent changes, and tracing data flow. Phase 2 (Pattern Analysis) compares broken code against working examples. Phase 3 (Hypothesis and Testing) applies the scientific method with minimal changes. Phase 4 (Implementation) creates a failing test, implements a single fix, and verifies.\n\nIncludes three supporting techniques: Root Cause Tracing (trace bugs backward through call stacks), Defense-in-Depth (validate at every layer), and Condition-Based Waiting (replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling). Real-world data shows systematic debugging achieves 95% first-time fix rates vs 40% with random approaches, and is 4-6x faster than thrashing.",
